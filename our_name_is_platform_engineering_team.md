# Our name is The Platform Engineering Team

## Context

As the team of people who make decisions about and patterns for deploying LIT
applications came together, we needed a name to describe some aspects of the
work. In particular we needed names for:

* the activity this team is doing
* the group of people doing that activity
* the collective output/work of the team

The DevOps Toolkit video ["Devops is Dead! Log Live Platform Engineering! Did We
get Confused?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_v77YiSGEY) (especially the
secion at [12:32](https://youtu.be/9_v77YiSGEY?t=752)) inspired the creation of
this team, and in the video this work is called "Platform Engineering".

It was imporant that the name describe the work that we are doing, and that it
not be distracting when talked about in meetings. That ruled out names like

* cuddly barnacle (an in-joke about github automatic repository naming)
* The Shipping Industry (a reasonable metaphor, but hard to take seriously)
* ShipIt (too indirect and too cute)

"The Deploy System" was considered because it describes more-or-less what we're
doing and it would draw attention to the similarity between this team and The
Design System. We did not choose this name because:

1. It would look too much like The Design System, and be abbreviated the same
   way: "DS"
1. We have even more projects that start with "d" like "Deep Blue" and "Deep
   Blue Data" and "Deep Blue Docs".
1. The word "deployment" is a particular Kubernetes term, so its use here as a
   term for everything that this group does is confusing.
1. This group's scope may include more than "deploying" systems, although the
   Design System is also more expansive than the name suggests so this may be
   not be a big problem.

"The Platform" was considered as the name for the "collective output/work of the
team." We did not choose this name because:

1. "The Platform" has a connotation of being "the one and only way of doing
   something"
1. There is a history in LIT of the phrase "The Platform", and we do not want to
   draw a connection between this group and those ideas
1. The idea of "The Platform" being an expansive term for "the collection of
   ways we put applications out into the world" is not an industry-wide accepted
   idea
1. In general the term "platform" for tech products and service can refer to
   many different things, most of which is not what we're doing on this team.

## Decision

* the activity this team is doing: *Platform Engineering*
* the group of people doing that activity: *The Platform Engineering Team*
* the collective output/work of the team: *The work of The Platform Engineering
  Team* i.e. there is no official name

We chose *Platform Engineering* because that is the industry term for the work
this group is doing. Adding the word "team" to describe the group of people is
straight-forward to understand.

We are choosing **not** to give a name to the
collective output because it doesn't need an official branded name. People will
know to look for the work of the team under the name "Platform Engineering". We
can talk about the work without referring to the collective output of the team.

That said, @niquerio will probably refer to it as "The compendium of ways in
which LIT applications are put out into the world".

## Consequences

* This team can be comfortably and confidently discussed in meetings
* The work that this team is doing can be readily understood because the name
  aligns with the work
* The name alone will give people outside of the organization a good initial
  idea of what this group does because it's a term used in the industry
* People *may* be frustrated that there isn't a name for the collective output
  of the team because having one might make it easier to explain some ideas
