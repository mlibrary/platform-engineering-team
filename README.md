ADRs for the Platform Engineering Team

[What is an ADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/)

## Workflow for adding an ADR
1. Make a branch with a relevant name; Use kebab case 🍢 because it will be a url. 
2. Make a draft pull request for the branch. If there's a corresponding Jira Issue, link to it.
3. Make a file for your ADR. 
    - Don't put a number on the file name.
    - Don't put a number on the header.
    - Use snake case 🐍 for the file name. 
4. When it's ready for review by the team, change the pull request to ready for review.
5. When the ADR is merged in:
    - The file name is given a number 
    - The header is given a number
    - A date is added to the file
